# gdb-pages-test
test of GitHub pages (aka gh-pages)

This a README file that is located in the `main` branch and should _not_ be also in the `gh-pages` orphan branch. Same would be true for any other files in the `main` branch. The only files that should show up in the `gh-pages` are doc pages. 

In this simple test, the built gdb documentation HTML files will be in the `gh-pages` branch and, upon publication, they will be served up by GitHub, but by way of https://xmnboy.github.com/gdb-doc-test.
